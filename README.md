# InfoVisProjectGroup6

More and more foreign tourists are visiting the Netherlands, which creates jobs and income. In order to spread tourism more throughout the country, it is vital for the government, businessmen and investors to be able to see the patterns and relations of its tourism data. For the display of tourism data, the current situation is more about the simple calculation of statistical data such as averages. We attempt to provide an interactive data visualization that allows different users to explore the tourism data over the years to see trends and identify potential opportunities. We hope our visualization work can contribute to more scientific and targeted measures to stimulate tourism.

This data visualization project is interactive, which is based on Dutch tourism data using JavaScript with the help of D3 framework. You can find useful information like accommodation types and nationality distribution of foreign tourists from different provinces in the Netherlands. Below is a preview of the visualization project.
